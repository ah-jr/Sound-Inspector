# Sound-Inspector
This is a application for Windows coded in C that analyses the audio files in .wav format (22050Hz) and generate graphs of the waveform. 
It runs a basic Fourier Transform algorithm to generate the frequency spectrum in real time. 
I used the SDL library to create the windows and the graphs. Other than that, no external libraries were used.

How to use:

1. Move both 'Sound Inspector.exe' and 'SDL2.dll' to the same folder.
2. Create a folder named 'WAV files'
3. Move your wav files to that folder and launch the .exe file.
4. The program itself is self-explanatory.
